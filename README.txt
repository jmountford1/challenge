For this project, I chose Python & the Django framework 
as the two core components of my tech stack.

I chose these two because of the nature of the task: having many dynamic elements indicates
a project will need to be scaleable & efficient, and Django checks both of those boxes.
It also comes packaged with SQLite, which made this all the more better.
Python is also excellent for data manipulation, and Django comes packaged with a 
database interface for even more control over the data.

This project was also hand-written in HTML/CSS/JS, with some jQuery and Bootstrap mixed in.

The Python script to import the csv data is located in the top-level directory, and is called
loadflavors.py

The requirements.txt was the contents of my Python plugins, but I believe all you should need
to run the server is w3lib, django_extensions, and the django module. Otherwise just install
as needed. Run the migrations, everything should work.

Thanks!
